#### Overview

The `BTCEVM`, `EVMBTC`, `BTCSOL` and `SOLBTC` contracts, built on the core functionalities defined by the `Core` contract, facilitates cross-network trades between the `Bitcoin Network`, `EVM-compatible Networks` (Ethereum, Base, etc.), and `Solana Network`. This contract enables efficient and secure trade execution and confirmation, supporting multiple stages in the trade lifecycle, from initial trade submission to settlement. The contracts integrate with external protocols and systems, such as external helper (`Router`, `VaultRegistry`, `Signer`) contracts, and a `Management` contract, to handle routing, token and network verification, MPC (multi-party computation) signatures, and trade data validation.

#### Key Components and Descriptions

1.  Multi-Stage Trade Lifecycle: Each trade follows a predefined series of stages, which include trade information submission, deposit confirmation, `PMM` (Private Market Maker) selection, payment processing, and final settlement. The trade flow follows the below stages in sequence:

    - Submit Trade Info: Initiates the trade by validating and recording essential details, including deposit and token information.
    - Confirm Deposit: Confirms the initial deposit on the source network.
    - Select PMM: Determines the most suitable PMM for trade fulfillment.
    - Make Payment: Processes payment on the destination network, with signature validation.
    - Confirm Payment: Confirms payment completion to the user's receiving address.
    - Confirm Settlement: Finalizes trade by confirming the cross-network transaction.

2.  Role-Based Access Control: The contract defines specific roles (`Owner`, `Solver`, `MPC Node`) and associates access permissions based on roles using `onlyManagementOwner()`, `onlySolver()`, and `onlyMPCNode()` modifiers to restrict functionality based on role context.

3.  Suspension State Validation: All critical functions use the `isSuspended()` modifier to ensure that if the contract is in a suspended state, further operations are halted.
